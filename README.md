#### Weather in the Netherlands
In order to run the code, you will first need to donwload the weather data for "De Bilt" as proxy for the Netherlands https://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/klimatologie/daggegevens. Temperature is measured in the tenth of degrees Celsius in the dataset. So, it needs to be converted to Celsius degrees by dividing with 10. (see data/weather_data.csv)
